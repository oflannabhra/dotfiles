### What is this?

This is a backup of all of my personal configuration settings

### What is in it?

* SublimeText 3
* PHPStorm 8
* .bash_profile
* .gitconfig

### How do I use it?

Well, depending on your personal setup, you can probably copy these files over, but I would definitely recommend that you open them up and see what they are doing, especially the dotfiles.

### Why would I ever want to do that?

Because these are awesome and you can do fancy stuff with them, like have pretty stuff.
